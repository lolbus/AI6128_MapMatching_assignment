## Setup instructions:
Task2_src.ipynb, Task3_src.ipynb, Task4_src.ipynb, Task5_src.ipynb, Task6_src.ipynb can be run by ensuring the folder 'porto_whole1' is in the same folder  
Task6_src.ipynb can be run by ensuring the folder 'porto_big' is in the same folder.  
task3_fmm.py was run with command "python task3_fmm.py" using Ubuntu Focal with the FMM toolkit installed as per the guide provided by author: https://fmm-wiki.github.io/docs/installation/ubuntu.html
